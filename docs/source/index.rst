**Financial-Entity-Cleaner** is an open source python library that performs data cleaning/normalization on text,
including the special case of company's name and its legal term, country information based on ISO standard and
well known identifiers used in the financial sector.

This library was developed to support OS-Climate projects and has been succesfully applied for
pre-processing data in the `Entity-Matching <https://github.com/os-climate/esg-matching>`_ project.

.. seealso:: OS-Climate aims at building a data and software platform that will dramatically boost global capital flows
   into climate change mitigation and resilience. To know more about it, check the official web site on:
