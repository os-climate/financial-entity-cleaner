============================

Jupyter Notebooks
-------------------

The jupyter notebooks listed below provide a hands-on practice on how to apply the Financial-Entity-Cleaner in a
real-world python project. These notebooks make use of a fictional data set to illustrate the before-after effect of
using the library features on singular text instance and tabular data (from a .csv file or pandas dataframe).

- `How to clean up texts with pre-defined regex <https://github.com/os-climate/financial-entity-cleaner/blob/main/notebooks/how-to/Clean%20up%20texts%20with%20pre-defined%20regex.ipynb>`_
- `How to clean a company's name <https://github.com/os-climate/financial-entity-cleaner/blob/main/notebooks/how-to/Clean%20a%20company's%20name.ipynb>`_
- `How to normalize country information <https://github.com/os-climate/financial-entity-cleaner/blob/main/notebooks/how-to/Normalize%20country%20information.ipynb>`_
- `How to validate banking ids <https://github.com/os-climate/financial-entity-cleaner/blob/main/notebooks/how-to/Validate%20banking%20IDs.ipynb>`_


Full Demo on Entity-Matching
------------------------------

A video recording with full presentation + demo that makes use of the Financial-Entity-Cleaner for the purpose of
pre-processing data for the Entity-Matching use case is available
`here <https://github.com/os-climate/financial-entity-cleaner/blob/main/notebooks/how-to/Clean%20a%20company's%20name.ipynb>`_.
Its correspondent hands-on jupyter notebook can be found `here <https://github.com/os-climate/financial-entity-cleaner/blob/main/notebooks/how-to/Clean%20a%20company's%20name.ipynb>`_.


ETL Process
-------------

If you are interested to automate the cleaning process as part of a more robust ETL process in your organization,
check the :doc:`Automatic Cleaning <code/financial_entity_cleaner.auto_cleaner>` feature available in this library,
as well as its correspondent hands-on
`jupyter notebook <https://github.com/os-climate/financial-entity-cleaner/blob/main/notebooks/how-to/Clean%20a%20company's%20name.ipynb>`_.
